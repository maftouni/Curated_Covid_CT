# Curated_Covid_CT
We built a large lung CT scan dataset for COVID-19 by curating data from 7 different public datasets. These datasets have been publicly used in COVID-19 diagnosis literature and proven their efficiency in deep learning applications. Therefore, the merged dataset is expected to improve the generalization ability of deep learning methods by learning from all these resources together.
